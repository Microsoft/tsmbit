# Recommended browser for Mac

While using MakeCode with the Mac, the recommended browsers to use are [Google Chrome][chrome] or [Microsoft Edge][edge] since they have good support of WebUSB for seamless downloads. [Safari][safari] and [Mozilla Firefox][firefox] are also supported but downloads require a bit more user interaction.

Please see [here][technical] for technical information on which browsers are
supported, or check [here][versions] to see which version you are using.
