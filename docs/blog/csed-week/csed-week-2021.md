# Computer Science Education Week 2021

November 8, 2021 Computer Science Education Week is coming up December 6th – 12th. This is an annual event to raise the visibility of computer science in education, and to inspire teachers and students to complete an “Hour of Code” during this week.

For those of you already thinking about planning activities for CS Ed Week, here are some fun ideas using MakeCode!

MakeCode Arcade

The theme for this year’s CS Ed Week is “CS is Everywhere” – highlighting t how technology and computer science are helping us solve some of the world’s toughest problems,

The 2021 MakeCode Arcade activity focuses on the impact that computing can have in savigfthe environment – and specifically how computers and technology can help combat forest fires. The Save the Forest! activity guides students through creating a game that will start and spread a forest fire, and then code their airtanker plane to spray water to put out the flames.

MakeCode Arcade Game Jam

There’s nothing like a bit of competition to inspire people to code! In partnership with the US Department of State, we are running the first ever Global MakeCode Arcade Game Jam in December where students globally are invited to participate and show off the games they build using MakeCode Arcade. The competition starts on November 29th when the theme of the game jam is announced. Submissions are due by December 17th when we’ll feature some of the best games submitted!

This year’s Hour of Code experience is called “TimeCraft” where your player will travel back in time to fix Time Splits (mysterious errors in history) with the help of your Time Agent! There are 10 different coding challenges help save Jazz in the 1920’s, or to help change the shape of the Pyramids in Egypt from squares to triangles.

MakeCode for micro:bit

If you have micro:bits in the classroom, there are many fun introductory projects that will light up imaginations and creativity through physical computing. One of the most popular projects is the micro:pet where students will make and code their very own electronic pet! https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/microbit-pet/
