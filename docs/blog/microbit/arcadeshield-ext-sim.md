# Arcade shield extension/simulator for the micro:bit (V2)

## Arcade shields

The micro:bit V2 has an amazing amount of computational power for a tiny device. In fact, itâ€™s powerful enough to drive a small color display. If you have ever used [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/), you may have noticed there are a variety of [Arcade shields](https://makecode.com/blog/microbit/arcade-shield) now commercially available into which the micro:bit V2 plugs, turning it into a retro gaming device:

## New extension with simulator

With the [Arcade shield MakeCode extension for the micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/pkg/microbit-apps/arcadeshield), you can use any Arcade shield with the beta version of the MakeCode for micro:bit editor (https://makecode.microbit.org/beta). This gives you access to the best of both worlds:
-	**All the micro:bit blocks and APIs** you are used to working with
-	**New blocks for drawing** to the Arcade shield's display and responding to user input via its buttons and direction-pad (D-pad)

The extension also includes a simulator that lets you see how your game will look on the Arcade shield while you are developing it. The simulator is a great way to test your code without needing to have the Arcade shield connected to your micro:bit.

## Plotting the accelerometer

Here's a [MakeCode program](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:S82867-73191-89330-76938) that plots the micro:bit's accelerometer values on the Arcade shield display. 

## Your feedback welcome

We are excited to see what you create with the Arcade shield extension for the micro:bit. Please share your projects on the [MakeCode forum](https://forum.makecode.com/).
