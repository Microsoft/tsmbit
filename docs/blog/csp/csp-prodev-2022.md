It's hard to believe the academic year is almost over and Summer is on the horizon! This is a great time to start planning some professional development between camping and road trips.

For educators who are planning to teach AP Computer Science Principles (https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles), and interested in using the AP CS Principles with Microsoft MakeCode (https://makecode.com/csp) curriculum, we have free professional development opportunities available!

The AP CS Principles with Microsoft MakeCode curriculum is free and uses web-based technology and tools that can be accessed across platforms and devices. The curriculum is endorsed and approved by the College Board and uses MakeCode Arcade and game-based learning for increased student engagement. Learn more about the curriculum here https://makecode.com/csp.

There are 3 free online workshops available this summer for Teachers interested in using this curriculum next year.  Each workshop covers the same material – we are just offering 3 different sections to accommodate summer schedules.  We have limited capacity for each workshop, so register soon at the links below:

* Workshop 1: Tuesdays and Thursdays for 2 weeks, June 7th, 9th, 14th, and 16th
* Workshop 2: Daily, Tuesday-Friday, June 28th-July 1st
* Workshop 3: Wednesdays once a week, July 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th

These professional development workshops will focus on the AP Computer Science Principles course’s Big Ideas, Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge skills. Additionally, you will learn how Microsoft MakeCode’s curriculum meets the course’s learning objectives and prepares students for the AP Exam and Create Performance Task. By attending the training and using Microsoft MakeCode’s curriculum, you will be prepared with a syllabus, pacing plan, and lesson plans, PowerPoints, student handouts, and resources for every day of the course.

If you can’t make it to one of our online workshops, you can learn more about the curriculum through a 1-hour online course (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/teach-ap-computer-science-principles-makecode) or by watching this 30-minute video (https://youtu.be/SZtBqDp18Qo ).
